# GGXrdBackgroundGamepad

## Description

This patch for Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 allows the game to register controller and gamepad inputs even while the game's window is in the background. It is for version 2211 of the game (the version displayed in the bottom right corner on the main menu).

**If Steam Input is enabled, the game cannot process background inputs even if the patch was applied.**

## How to use

Download the latest release from the Releases section. Extract the .zip file, launch the patcher (on Linux launch the GGXrdBackgroundGamepad_linux instead) and select the game's GuiltyGearXrd.exe file. Usually it's located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-\Binaries\Win32`.and on Linux it should at `/home/YOUR_USER/.steam/debian-installation/steamapps/common/GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-/Binaries/Win32`.

You only ever need to do this once.

To unpatch the game, you must find a backup copy of the .exe from before the patch and use that instead.

**If Steam Input is enabled, the game cannot process background inputs even if the patch was applied.**
